## Status

This was my first ever rust project I learned a lot but the whole thing needs to be gutted and built from the ground up.
Dont really have time to firure out how to fix the unsoundess in it at the moment. Hopefully it compiles for you. It crashes for me 
when built in release mode. But seems to work okay in debug where its still plenty fast.
